We first loaded and analyzed the dataset to understand the structure and identify the important features. After cleaning and preprocessing the data, we divided it into training and testing sets. The training set was used to fit the Linear Regression model, which learns the best-fit line (y = wx + b) by minimizing the error between predicted and actual prices. The testing set was then used to evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE)
